# EmpaticaE4-analysis-tools

This repository contains a Steamlit Application to analyze biometric data that is recorded by the Empatica E4 wristband.
Empatica data is downloaded as a .zip file and contains individual biometric signals, recorded at their respective sampling frequency, and a timestamp in unix format, indicating the starting time of the recordings.

The app allows users to upload the .zip file containing the individual sensor recordings, and analyze them through a visual inspection.
